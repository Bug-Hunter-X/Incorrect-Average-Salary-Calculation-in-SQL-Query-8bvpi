This repository contains a SQL query with a common error related to the use of aggregate functions. The query attempts to find employees in the 'Sales' department whose salaries are above the average salary of all employees.  The original query produces an incorrect result due to the incorrect usage of the AVG function. The solution demonstrates the correct way to calculate and use the average salary in the WHERE clause using a subquery.
